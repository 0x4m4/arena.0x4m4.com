# Getting Started - A Beginner's Guide to Cybersecurity

## Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. It involves a range of activities such as defending against hacking attempts, securing data, and mitigating risks in both digital and physical environments. This guide will help beginners get started with the fundamental concepts and tools used in cybersecurity, with a focus on Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions.

### Why Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is vital in protecting sensitive information from malicious actors. With the growing reliance on technology, the need for skilled professionals has increased exponentially. CTF competitions provide an excellent hands-on way to learn the skills required to work in this field.

## Key Concepts

1. **CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**:
   - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring data is accessible only by authorized individuals.
   - **Integrity**: Preventing unauthorized modifications to data.
   - **Availability**: Ensuring that data and services are available to authorized users when needed.

2. **Cyber Threats**:
   - **Malware**: Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access.
   - **Phishing**: Social engineering attacks to steal credentials or sensitive information.
   - **DoS/DDoS Attacks**: Overloading systems to disrupt service availability.

3. **Basic Networking**:
   - Understanding protocols like TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and how data travels over networks is crucial in cybersecurity.

## CTF and Cybersecurity

Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are an excellent way to practice cybersecurity skills in a fun and engaging way. In CTFs, participants solve various challenges, each designed to test a specific skill (e.g., cryptography, binary exploitation, or web vulnerabilities). CTF platforms such as **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, and **picoCTF** provide beginner-friendly challenges.

### CTF Tips:
- Start with easier challenges to build your foundational skills.
- Join a team to learn from others and collaborate on challenges.
- Use tools like **Burp Suite** for web-related tasks and **pwntools** for exploitation tasks.
