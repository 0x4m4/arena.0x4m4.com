# Web Exploitation

Web exploitation involves finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. It's a crucial skill for both offensive security professionals and developers aiming to secure their applications.

## Key Concepts

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
2. **SQL Injection**: Inserting malicious SQL code into application queries.
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Tricking a user into performing unwanted actions on a web application.
4. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Causing the server to make requests to unintended locations.

## Common Web Vulnerabilities

1. **Broken Authentication**: Weaknesses in session management or user authentication.
2. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Inadequate protection of sensitive information.
3. **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection**: Exploiting XML parsers to access internal files or perform denial of service.
4. **Insecure Deserialization**: Exploiting the deserialization of untrusted data.

## Tools for Web Exploitation

- **Burp Suite**: An integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications.
- **OWASP ZAP**: An open-source web application security scanner.
- **SQLmap**: Automated SQL injection and database takeover tool.
- **BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)**: A penetration testing tool focused on web browsers.

## Basic Web Exploitation Challenge

Here's a simple PHP script vulnerable to SQL injection:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "user";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "myDB";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

// Get user input
$user_id = $_GET['id'];

// Vulnerable query
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $user_id";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    // Output data of each row
    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        echo "id: " . $row["id"]. " - Name: " . $row["name"]. " - Email: " . $row["email"]. "<br>";
    }
} else {
    echo "0 results";
}
$conn->close();
?>
```

To exploit this:

1. Understand that the user input is directly inserted into the SQL query without sanitization.
2. Craft a payload that modifies the SQL query's logic, e.g., `1 OR 1=1` to retrieve all users.
3. Use the payload in the URL: `http://example.com/vulnerable.php?id=1 OR 1=1`

Remember, always practice web exploitation ethically and only on applications you have explicit permission to test!
